🚀 What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+. It's based on:
@ Starlette (for web handling)
@ Pydantic (for data validation)


✅ Key Features:
Super fast (thanks to ASGI & async support)
Automatic interactive API docs (Swagger & Redoc)
Easy data validation using type hints
Built-in OAuth2, JWT, CORS, etc.
Production-ready

⚙️ How FastAPI Works (Simple Overview)
You define endpoints using Python functions.
Use type hints to auto-validate inputs.
FastAPI automatically generates:
          Swagger UI: /docs
          Redoc UI: /redoc

Under the hood, it's asynchronous and handles requests very efficiently.
